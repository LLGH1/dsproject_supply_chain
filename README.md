## Introduction of the project
The purpose of this study is to investigate how companies can conduct sentiment analysis based on Amazon.com reviews to gain more insights into customer experience. The dataset used in this study is the [Amazon US Customer Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cynthiarempel/amazon-us-customer-reviews-dataset).

The objective of this study is to build a model that can predict the star rating of reviews with a high accuracy and thus determine if the review is associated with a positive or negative sentiment. The basic NLP methods like tokenization, removing stop words, stemming and lemmatization, vectorization habe been applied to pre-process the data. The logistic regression has been used as the prediction model. 
## Development workflow of the project
### Structure of project-folder
project
- \dsproject_supply_chain\ # location of git repo
- \data\processed\  # data after pre-processing will be saved here
- \data\raw\ # raw data
- \data\processed_model\ # self-trained model including feature matrix will be saved here

### Workflow in GITREPO
[Our own GitHub Pages](https://github.com/LLGH1/dsproject_supply_chain.git)

Everyone has his/her own dev-repo (dev_firstname). Everyone can develop in their own dev-branch. 
We merge our work into the dev-branch and develop a final version together.
We push the final version into the main-branch. In the main-branch, we only keep the work which will finally be presented. 
### List of necessary python-packages
