### Workflow
Everyone has his/her own dev-repo (dev_firstname). Everyone can develop in their own dev-branch. 
We merge our work into the dev-branch and develop a final version together.
We push the final version into the main-branch. In the main-branch, we only keep the work which will finally be presented.
